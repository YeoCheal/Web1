<h3>Let's begin morning with relaxing.</h3>
The time is remain cause get up early.<br>
Eat breakfast with studying English.<br>
When I want to move on little bit,<br>
Wash a dishes and reading a book.<br>
Listen to the music with reading a book.<br>
And now My family wake up.<br>
'Good morning~!' and help them to ready to commute.<br>
I can help people in the mornig.<br>
It feels good.
